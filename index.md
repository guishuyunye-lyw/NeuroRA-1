![ ](img/logo.jpg)

**A Python Toolbox of Representational Analysis from Multimode Neural Data**

## Overview
**Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)** has become a popular and effective method to measure the representation of multivariable neural activity in different modes.

**NeuroRA** is an easy-to-use toolbox based on **Python**, which can do some works about RSA among nearly all kinds of neural data, including **behavioral, EEG, MEG, fNIRS, ECoG, electrophysiological and fMRI data**.

## Paper

Lu, Z., & Ku, Y. NeuroRA: A Python toolbox of representational analysis from multi-modal neural data. (bioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.008086)

## Installation

> pip install NeuroRA 

## Documentation

You can read or download the **[Tutorial here](https://neurora.github.io/NeuroRA/neurora/Tutorial.pdf)**.

## Required Dependencies:
- **[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org)**: a fundamental package for scientific computing
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)**: a Python 2D plotting library
- **[NiBabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/)**: a package prividing read +/- write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats
- **[Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/)**: a Python module for fast and easy statistical learning on NeuroImaging data
- **[MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/)**: a Python software for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data

## Features

    > **Section 2**: Preprocessing
    
    > **Section 3**: Calculating the neural pattern similarity
    
    > **Section 4**: Calculating single RDM and Plotting
    
    > **Section 5**: Calculating RDMs and Plotting
    
    > **Section 6**: Calculating the Similarity between two RDMs
    
    > **Section 7**: Calculating the Similarity and Plotting
    
    > **Section 8**: Calculating the RDMs for each channels

- **Demo 2 for fMRI**, based on Haxby dataset, includes 7 sections.

    > **Section 1**: loading example data
    
    > **Section 2**: Preprocessing
    
    > **Section 3**: Calculating the neural pattern similarity (for ROI)
    
    > **Section 4**: Calculating the neural pattern similarity (Searchlight)
